            <li>If you are filing for your spouse, he or she must complete and sign Form I-130A, Supplemental Information for Spouse Beneficiary.  If your spouse is overseas, Form I-130A must still be completed, but your spouse does not have to sign Form I-130A.  Form I-130A must be submitted with Form I-130.</li><br />
            <li>There is no visa category for married children of lawful permanent residents.  If you are a lawful permanent resident and you filed Form I-130 for your unmarried son or daughter, but your son or daughter marries before immigrating to the United States or adjusting status to lawful permanent resident, we will deny or automatically revoke your petition.</li><br />
            <li>Non-citizen U.S. nationals (as defined in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) section 308) have the same rights as lawful permanent residents to petition for family members.  If you are a U.S. national born in American Samoa or Swains Island (or who otherwise qualifies as a non-citizen U.S. national, as described in INA section 308), you should indicate in Part 2., Item Number 36. of the petition that you are a lawful permanent resident.  You do not need to list an Alien Registration Number (A-Number) in Part 2., Item Number 1. of the petition.</li><br />
            <li>If the beneficiary qualifies under Items 1.C., 1.D., or 1.E. above, you are not required to file separate petitions for the beneficiary’s spouse or unmarried children under 21 years of age.  They are considered derivative beneficiaries and you should list them in Part 4. of this petition.</li><br />
            <li>If you are the lawful permanent resident petitioner and the beneficiary qualifies under Items 2.A., 2.B., or 2.C. above, you are not required to file separate petitions for the beneficiary’s unmarried children under 21 years of age.  They are considered derivative beneficiaries and you should list them in Part 4. of this petition.</li><br />
            <li>The derivative beneficiaries described in Items 4. and 5. above may apply for an immigrant visa along with the beneficiary.</li>

                        <b>Signature.</b>  Each petition must be properly signed and filed.  For all signatures on this petition, USCIS will not accept a stamped or typewritten name in place of a signature.  A legal guardian may also sign for a mentally incompetent person.<br /><br />
                        <b>Filing Fee.</b>  Each petition must be accompanied by the appropriate filing fee.  (See the What Is the Filing Fee section of these Instructions.)<br /><br />
                        <b>Biometric Services Fee.</b>  If you file this petition with USCIS, you do not need to include a biometric services fee at the time you submit your petition.  If you are later notified that you must submit biometrics, you will receive a biometric services appointment notice with instructions on how to submit the additional biometric services fee.  If you file this petition with an agency other than USCIS, please check with that agency to determine if and when you must submit a biometric services fee.<br /><br />
                        <b>Evidence.</b>  At the time of filing, you must submit all evidence and supporting documentation listed in the General Requirements section of these Instructions.  USCIS may issue a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) or a Denial Notice for petitions filed without the required supporting evidence. <br /><br />
                        <b>Biometric Services Appointment.</b>  USCIS may require that you appear for an interview or provide fingerprints, photograph, and/or signature at any time to verify your identity, obtain additional information, and conduct background and security checks, including a check of criminal history records maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), before making a decision on your application, petition, or request.  After USCIS receives your petition and ensures it is complete, we will inform you in writing, if you need to attend a biometric services appointment.  If an appointment is necessary, the notice will provide you the location of your local or designated USCIS Application Support Center (ASC) and the date and time of your appointment or, if you are currently overseas, instruct you to contact a U.S. Embassy, U.S. Consulate, or USCIS office outside the United States to set up an appointment.

If your answer to a question which requires a numeric response is zero or none (for example, “How many children do you have” or “How many times have you departed the United States”), type or print “None,” unless otherwise directed.</li><br />

            If U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) or USCIS issued the beneficiary a Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record, provide the beneficiary’s Form I-94 number and date that his or her authorized period of stay expires or expired (as shown on Form I-94).  The Form I-94 number also is known as the Departure Number on some versions of Form I-94.<br /><br />
            NOTE:  If the beneficiary was admitted to the United States by CBP at an airport or seaport after April 30, 2013, he or she may have been issued an electronic Form I-94 by CBP, instead of a paper Form I-94.  The beneficiary may visit the CBP website at www.cbp.gov/i94 to obtain a paper version of his or her electronic Form I-94.  CBP does not charge a fee for this service.  Some travelers admitted to the United States at a land border, airport, or seaport, after April 30, 2013 with a passport or travel document, who were issued a paper Form I-94 by CBP, may also be able to obtain a replacement Form I-94 from the CBP website without charge.  If his or her Form I-94 cannot be obtained from the CBP website, it may be obtained by filing Form I-102, Application for Replacement/Initial Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Record, with USCIS.  USCIS does charge a fee for this service.<br /><br />
            Passport and Travel Document Numbers.  Complete Part 4., Item Numbers 45. - 50., as applicable, if the beneficiary relative used a passport or travel document to travel to the United States, enter either the passport or travel document information in the appropriate space on the petition, even if the passport or travel document is currently expired.
